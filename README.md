# Snake Game

## Description

This game is written in Java swing based on a snake game similar to that found on certain old mobile phones. This game involves the snake and needs to eat foods that make it longer, and the objective is to avoid moving into a border or the snake itself for as long as possible. The player loses the game when the snake moves into the end of the boundary or its own body. As a result, the game becomes more challenging as it goes on due to the growth of the snake.
